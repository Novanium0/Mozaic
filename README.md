# Mozaic
Our project for doing some mozaic in PCSI with Python and matplotlib.


In this depository, you can find all the work made by PELOSO Lucas and MERSADIER Thomas about a "mozaic-reconstruction" from little "pictures" to remake a huge one.
You can use and improve it as you wish.

You can contact us at thomas@valcary.fr for exemple.
